# Miner

You will be receiving data in the form defined in `infinite_games/events/base.py` and will only need to complete the `probability` entry. 

The current scoring mechanism is described [here](https://hackmd.io/@nielsma/S1sB8xO_C). The time-series component is not applied to Azuro events since in their case the interval between event generation and event resolution is usually shorter than a few hours.

A key point for the first iteration of the subnet is that you will be receiving requests from validators every minute. **You do not have to recalculate your prediction every time**. Our baseline miners are implementing a caching system that allows for a recalculation schedule. This is particularly important if you use a base model like GPT4 that might be expensive.

## Baseline Miner

We are constantly working on improving the baseline miners, especially with regards to new categories of synthetic events being added to the subnet.

1. Baseline Miner 1

This miner pulls the latest price from Polymarket, which corresponds to the current aggregate prediction on Polymarket, and sends it to the validators. Similarly, it pull the latest odds for a given Azuro event and sends the inverse (which is the corresponding probability) to validators.

code: run the miner without setting up an OpenAI key

2. Baseline Miner 2 (LLM integration)

We integrate the LLM prompting [pipeline](https://github.com/dannyallover/llm_forecasting.git) with news retrieval developed by the authors of the forecasting LLM paper quoted in the readme. In the current form it only uses [Google News](https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) for news retrieval while the original model from the article used 4 other different sources (Newscatcher, Newsdata.io, Aylien, NewsAPI.org).
This pipeline can work with different base models.

**version 1**
GPT4 as base model. 

steps: 
- add an OpenAI key (OPENAI_KEY) to your local environment

**version 2**
GPT-3.5 and GPT4 Mini as base models.

steps:
- add an OpenAI key to your local environment
- add the parameter 1 to the `get_prediction` function in `miner.py`

```llm_prediction = (await self.llm.get_prediction(market, 1))```

**version 3**

Gemini as base model

steps:
- add a Google Gemini key (GOOGLE_AI_KEY) to your local environment
- add the parameter 2 to the `get_prediction` function in `miner.py`

```llm_prediction = (await self.llm.get_prediction(market, 2))```

**version 4**
GPT-3.5 (used for reasoning) and Gemini as base models

steps:
- add an OpenAI key and a Google Gemini key (GOOGLE_AI_KEY) to your local environment
- add the parameter 3 to the `get_prediction` function in `miner.py`

```llm_prediction = (await self.llm.get_prediction(market, 3))```

You can also set up your own configurations.


## Sample data for generated events from ACLED

We join [here](docs/ACLED-data/protest-data-3days.json) and [here](docs/ACLED-data/Protests-events-7-days.json) two dataset of events that stretches over 6 months (from January 2024 to June 2024) which represents the type of events that will be sent to miners from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) data.

This first set of events will have the following structure:
"Will the amount of protests in [country] during [3 days window or 1 week window] be above [30 day moving average] ?"

**Key details**:
- the countries will initially be EU countries (with non degenerate protest rates) and the US. This is the exact list: ['Germany', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Poland', 'Romania', 'Netherlands', 'Belgium', 'Ireland', 'Sweden', 'Czech Republic', 'Greece', 'Portugal', 'Hungary', 'Austria', 'Serbia', 'Bulgaria', 'Denmark', 'United States']
- the cutoff will be set at the start of the time window
- events will be generated daily but they will only resolve on Tuesday-Wednesday due to the schedule ACLED follows to update its data.

Miners will have to retrieve protest data relevant to each of the countries listed above in order to improve their predictions. 

## Cutoff

**Polymarket** : 24 hours before the resolution date.

**Azuro** : the start date of the sporting event.

# Miner strategy 

A reference providing a **baseline miner** strategy is the article ["Approaching Human Level Forecasting with Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.18563v1?s=35) ([1]). The authors fine-tune an LLM to generate predictions on binary events (including the ones listed on Polymarket) which nears the performance of human forecasters when submitting a forecast for each prediction, and which beats human forecasters in a setting where the LLM can choose to give a prediction or not based on its confidence.

The authors released a version of the code they used to build the LLM they describe in the paper. You can find it [here](https://github.com/dannyallover/llm_forecasting.git).


# System requirements

The computational requirements for a miner will depend significantly on the frequency at which they need to send predictions to be competitive since the base model we consider consists of a set of LLM sub-modules that each need to perform computations. Miners will also need to eventually continually provide new data to their models. Initially with 20-30 events settling per day we estimate miners to require between 16 and 36GB of RAM. We are in the process of testing the computational requirements further. 

A significant cost in the case of the repo referenced above is the cost of using e.g the OpenAI API as well as the cost of retrieving news data. Every time a prediction is produced, a base model is used to generate various prompts. A miner could circumvent that by using a local model or by using the output of the [subnet 18](https://github.com/corcel-api/cortex.t.git). 
News retrieval other than Google News is done through news provider like https://www.newscatcherapi.com/. They are most often behind a paywall.


# Getting Started



First clone this repo by running `git clone `. Then to run a miner:


Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amedeo-gigaver/infinite_games.git
```

Change directory

```bash
cd infinite_games
```

Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Enable `torch`:

```bash
export USE_TORCH=1
```

The venv should be active whenever the neurons are run.

## 2. Create Wallets

This step creates local coldkey and hotkey pairs for your miner.

The miner will be registered to the subnet specified. This ensures that the miner can run the respective miner scripts.

Create a coldkey and hotkey for your miner wallet.

```bash
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name miner
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name miner --wallet.hotkey default
```

## 2a. (Optional) Getting faucet tokens

Faucet is disabled on the testnet. Hence, if you don't have sufficient faucet tokens, ask the Bittensor Discord community for faucet tokens. Go to the help-forum on the Discord and post your request in the "Requests for Testnet TAO" thread.

## 3. Register keys

This step registers your subnet miner keys to the subnet.

```bash
btcli subnet register --wallet.name miner --wallet.hotkey default
```

To register your miner on the testnet add the `--subtensor.network test` flag.

Follow the below prompts:

```bash
>> Enter netuid (0): # Enter the appropriate netuid for your environment
Your balance is: # Your wallet balance will be shown
The cost to register by recycle is œÑ0.000000001 # Current registration costs
>> Do you want to continue? [y/n] (n): # Enter y to continue
>> Enter password to unlock key: # Enter your wallet password
>> Recycle œÑ0.000000001 to register on subnet:8? [y/n]: # Enter y to register
üì° Checking Balance...
Balance:
  œÑ5.000000000 ‚û° œÑ4.999999999
‚úÖ Registered
```

## 4. Check that your keys have been registered

This step returns information about your registered keys.

Check that your miner key has been registered:

```bash
btcli wallet overview --wallet.name miner
```

To check your miner on the testnet add the `--subtensor.network test` flag

The above command will display the below:

```bash
Subnet: TBD # or 155 on testnet
COLDKEY    HOTKEY   UID  ACTIVE  STAKE(œÑ)     RANK    TRUST  CONSENSUS  INCENTIVE  DIVIDENDS  EMISSION(œÅ)   VTRUST  VPERMIT  UPDATED  AXON  HOTKEY_SS58

                                                                                Wallet balance: œÑ0.000999999
```

## Running a Miner
