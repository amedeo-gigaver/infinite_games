Example 3:
title: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?
body: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: 
- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.
- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.
- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.
In the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.

Example 4:
title: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?
body: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.
